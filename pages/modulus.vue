          Knowledge is granted to those who master sigils. By self-patching outputs back to inputs, you draw seals on the surface of the module. Should your sigil be well-conceived, you will gain grand knowledge.

          The module is available in three different form factors. All three are identical, but offer a different amount of maximum nodes.

          - **Modulellus Salomonis Regis**: 4 maximum nodes, 30hp. This is good for chords.
          - **Modulus Salomonis Regis**: 8 maximum nodes, 50hp. This is the recommended variant.
          - **Modulissimus Salomonis Regis**: 16 maximum nodes, 89hp. You should not consider this one if this is your first ritual.

          While I recommend you get started on **Modulus Salomonis Regis**, the 8 nodes version, in this documentation, we will use a picture of **Modulellus Salomonis Regis**, the 4 nodes version, to fit on the screen easier.

          Whenever **Modulus Salomonis Regis** is mentioned on this page, it is interchangeable with the two other variants.

          Understanding **Modulus Salomonis Regis** is easier if we create a little patch first, before explaining the controls in detail. You can follow along on any version of the module you want.

          To move through the nodes, at least one of the five **Step Inputs** must receive triggers or gates.

      ModuleBox(jack="out" to="modulellus" :x="119/900" :y="101/760" align="right")
        :markdown-it
          **Queue**: Move to one of the enqueued nodes, selected at random from the queue if there is more than one. If no nodes are enqueued, then this input does nothing.
        ModuleImageInsert(src="/modules/modulus/queue.png").float-left
        :markdown-it
          Nodes can be added to the queue from their corresponding **Q (Queue)** jack, or by pressing their **Q (Queue)** button. When in the queue, the word **Queue** is lit on the segment display.
        ModuleImageInsert(src="/modules/modulus/keep.png").float-left
        :markdown-it
          When the rocker switch next to the **Queue** input is set to **Keep**, other enqueued steps will not be removed from the queue after one is picked at random. If it's set to **Reset**, then the queue will be emptied of the other options.

      ModuleBox(jack="out" to="modulellus" :x="30/900" :y="190/760" align="right")

          **Teleport**: Move to a random node.
        ModuleImageInsert(src="/modules/modulus/new.png").float-left.clear-both
        :markdown-it
          If the rocker switch is set to **New**, it will never teleport back to the current step (unless only a single step is enabled). If it is set to **Any**, then the current step will be considered a valid destination.

          **Walk**: Move one node to the left or right randomly. When at either edge, wraps around.
        ModuleImageInsert(src="/modules/modulus/new.png").float-left.clear-both
        :markdown-it
          If the rocker switch is set to **New**, it will perform a random walk, 50/50. If it is set to **Any**, then there is 1 chance out of 3 of staying on the current step instead of walking.

      ModuleBox(jack="out" to="modulellus" :x="178/900" :y="278/760" align="right")
        :markdown-it
          **Back**: Move one node to the left. When at the beginning, wraps around.

      ModuleBox(jack="out" to="modulellus" :x="207/900" :y="190/760" align="right")
        :markdown-it
          **Forward**: Move one node to the right. When at the end, wraps around.

      ModuleBox(align="right")
        :markdown-it
          When multiple step inputs receive a gate or trigger at the exact same time, inputs are processed in the following order of priority: **Queue** > **Teleport** > **Walk** > **Back** > **Forward**. The arrow displayed on the summoning circle will remind you of this.

          You can exploit these priorities by sending different clock divisions to different inputs, or to patch a fallback option for the **Queue** input.

      ModuleBox(align="right")
        ModuleImageInsert(src="/modules/modulus/nodes.png").float-left
        :markdown-it
          You can use the **Nodes** knob to use fewer nodes than the maximum. Unused nodes will be dimmer on the segment display. They can still be programmed, but they cannot be reached by **Step Inputs**.

    ModuleSubSection(subtitle="Step Windows" align="center")
      ModuleBox(align="center")
        :markdown-it
          As soon as a **Step Input** is accepted, a **Step Window** of 1 millisecond opens. During that time, the CV inputs of every node become active. Outside of **Step Windows**, the nodes will not react to CV input.

      Protip(align="center")
        :markdown-it
          Not only there is no good justification for trying to understand how **Step Windows** work, it's actually harmful to even attempt to.

      ModuleBox(align="center" width="60rem")
        :markdown-it
          Here's precisely how things happen:

          1. A valid **Step Input** is received. A **Step Window** opens for a millisecond.
          2. The CV inputs of nodes listen for incoming triggers or gates. They can't accept multiple triggers during the **Step Window**, either they receive something or nothing.
          3. The **Step Window** closes: every node processes every input it received. **Sub** and **Add** inputs can cancel out each other.
          4. The **Step** is applied: a **Global Trig** is sent, the **Global CV** is updated (with **Slide** if any), the current node's **Play** indicator lights up, and the new current node sends out its gate outputs continuously, until the next **Step Window** _closes_. Thus, the gates the current node is sending will be picked up during the next **Step Window**.
          5. The module waits 2 milliseconds before allowing another **Step Input** to be received.
          6. Once another **Step Input** is received, another **Step Window** opens for a millisecond.
          7. The outputs from _step 4_ are still active: if they are patched, they are picked up during this **Step Window**.
          8. The **Step Window** closes, and the outputs from _step 4_ no longer send output.

      ModuleBox(align="center")
        :markdown-it
          In software, every single patchcable adds one sample of latency to its signal, by design.

          The purpose of **Step Windows** is to make it easier to patch signals through external logic modules before patching them back into **Modulus Salomonis Regis**. So long as you pick logic modules that work at audio rates and do not add latency, you can patch a signal through more logic processors than you'd ever need and still make it in time to be picked up by the **Step Window**.

          The lowest sampling rate generally used for audio is 44,100 samples per second: that means at least 44 samples per millisecond, the duration of a **Step Window**.

          **Modulus Salomonis Regis** adds one millisecond of latency to incoming triggers, and can't move through more than 333 nodes per second. These limitations are negligible for most use cases.

          The **LCD** shows you the note being played, the number of the current node, and gives you contextual information for a few seconds when you turn knobs.

        ModuleImageInsert(src="/modules/modulus/save.png").float-right.clear-both
        :markdown-it
          The **Save** button saves the current node pattern in memory. There is only a single memory slot.

          The **Load** button loads it.

          As usual, I do not provide CV control over every button, but it's possible to automate them with [CV-MAP](https://library.vcvrack.com/Stoermelder-P1/CVMap) or [ÂµMAP](https://library.vcvrack.com/Stoermelder-P1/CVMapMicro).

          The **Reset** jack listens to input **continuously**, not just during **Step Windows**. When it receives a trig or gate, its behavior can be customized from the **right-click menu**:

          - **Reset input goes back to the first step** (enabled by default)
          - **Reset input loads the saved pattern** (enabled by default)
          - **Reset input quantizes the pattern** (disabled by default)

          Multiple behaviors can be enabled simultaneously.

          Every node behaves identically, and can store four states:

          - **Pitch**: Only twelve-tone equal temperament notes, no arbitrary CV. The asterisk stands for "Sharp". After changing the scale, pitches are not automatically quantized.
          - **Play**: One and only one node is playing at all times. In addition to the play arrow, the node being played flashes for a split second when reached: it helps identifying repeating nodes, and helps you follow the movement when the module is heavily self-patched.
          - **Queue**: When added to the queue, a node can be picked by the **Queue Step Input**. The **Queue** marker will be cleared if the node is played via **Queue Step Input**, or if a **Queue Step Input** picks another node while in **Reset** mode. When reached from another **Step Input** than the **Queue Step Input**, the **Queue** marker is not lost.
          - **Delay**: The last node to have played has this **Delay** marker. If a node repeats, it will have the **Play** and the **Delay** marker at the same time.
